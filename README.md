# LibMPVDelphi
LibMPV video player for Delphi VCL/Delphi Firemonkey/Free Pascal.

A Delphi/FPC convertion of LibMPV interface and a video player class that can be directly used in Delphi or Lazarus.

Status: alpha. But I do use this player in my Windows App.

The FireMonkey version player control currently only supports Windows. I am a newbie to FireMonkey and will try my best to implement the MacOS/Linux version when I am free. You are VERY welcome to contribute your implementation.

What is MPV: https://mpv.io/

You need to download "mpv-2.dll" (32bit/64bit) from
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/
before running the demo project(s).
